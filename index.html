    <p>My name is Rafael Lereno and I am currently a student of WDD130. I have been working at Mutual LLC for 4 years, currently as a support analyst. At church, I serve as the ward secretary and have also been an EnglishConnect 1 teacher for the past 3 years. I’m passionate about learning web development and improving my programming skills. In my free time, I enjoy playing online games and watching soccer — I’m a Sport Club Internacional fan. I also find joy in helping others and growing both personally and professionally.
